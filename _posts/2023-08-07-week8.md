## Week 8 (August 7th - August 11th)

**August 7th:** <br/>  
In the latest phase of our research, I reached a significant milestone by completing all the graphs that are a crucial component of our study. These graphs provide a visual representation of our findings, offering a clearer and more intuitive understanding of how the CLIP models perform in different scenarios.

As part of this process, I began organizing and transferring these graphs into Apple Numbers, a tool that will help us manage and analyze our data efficiently. The transition to Apple Numbers enables us to centralize our data and streamline our analytical workflow, further enhancing our ability to extract valuable insights.

In addition to graph completion, I have also taken the crucial step of compiling the data from all three benchmark scenarios: easy, medium, and hard. This comprehensive dataset, organized per model, provides a holistic view of how these models perform across a range of difficulty levels. This compilation is fundamental to our research, as it sets the stage for in-depth analysis and valuable conclusions.

As we move forward, these graphs and compiled data will be instrumental in uncovering trends, patterns, and insights into gender bias in media portrayal. This comprehensive approach to data management and analysis strengthens our research and brings us closer to our goal of contributing meaningful insights to this important field. Stay tuned for more exciting updates as we continue our research journey.
