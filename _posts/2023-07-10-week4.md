## Week 4 (July 10th - July 14th)

**July 10th:**  
I've been working on getting all the portraits of the athletes and actors in line and making sure the pictures are clear and visible. I had to comb through the already downloaded datasets and ensure this. Due to this, I had to change out some pictures because they where blurry, had someone else in it, or did not feel like a portrait. After this, I started with athletes and turned their demographics into a table in a text file. Here is the table I made today for athletes:

---+--------+------------------+------------+------
    | FileName | Name               | Sport        | Gender
0   | 0.jpg    | John Elway         | Football     | Man   
1   | 1.jpg    | Serena Williams    | Tennis       | Woman 
2   | 2.jpg    | Charles Barkley    | Basketball   | Man   
3   | 3.jpg    | Emma Raducanu      | Tennis       | Woman 
4   | 4.jpg    | Alexi Lalas        | Soccer       | Man   
5   | 5.jpg    | Steven Gerrard     | Soccer       | Man   
6   | 6.jpg    | George Best        | Soccer       | Man   
7   | 7.jpg    | Yao Ming           | Basketball   | Man   
8   | 8.jpg    | Michael Schumacher | Racing       | Man   
9   | 9.jpg    | Randy Couture      | Martial Arts | Man   
10  | 10.jpg   | Shaun White        | Snowboarding | Man   

Here are a couple of lines from the table so that you can understand the format. From the table you can see that I included the number in the dataset, name of the file in the dataset, name, sport, and gender. This table is slightly different from the ones I created last year for politicians as those included political affiliation.
