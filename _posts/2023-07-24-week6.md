## Week 6 (July 24th - July 28th)

**July 24th:**  
In the latest phase of our research project, I've made significant progress towards gathering and organizing results for the actors dataset. This step is pivotal in expanding our understanding of gender bias in media portrayal. With a dedicated effort, I've successfully collected the results for each individual within the dataset and initiated the process of structuring this data into tables, making it more accessible and interpretable.

The decision to arrange the data per person per clip model in tables is a significant leap forward in terms of data organization. This approach will facilitate easier analysis and comparison, enhancing the efficiency of our research and enabling us to draw more precise conclusions. It's a substantial step toward ensuring that our research is as transparent and comprehensible as possible.

Simultaneously, I've been actively working on transferring the collected results, stored in JSON files, to our private GitHub repository. While the repository is currently private, the intention is to transition it to a public platform once all the code is finalized and the research reaches a stage where sharing insights and findings with the wider community is appropriate.

This commitment to transparency and open access to our research is an important aspect of our project's ethos. We're working diligently to make our work available to the public, fostering collaboration and the potential for collective insights in the future. As we continue to make progress, I look forward to sharing more updates and insights as we move forward with our research objectives.

Here are some examples of the pictures in the data set:
