## Week 3 (July 3rd - July 7th)

**July 3rd:** 

Today, I got back to work on my code. Tomorrow is the 4th of July so I am trying to finish up most of my work today. From my work last Summer, I have webpages that detail the results of all my tests. For this reason, we want to start an API so that I can share my results with the public. This said I was working on adding all of the base benchmark scores under the photos of each politician for each model. This meant that I had to start using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to start writing scripts for the webpage. I was doing my work today in the coffee house at Rice which has the cheapest coffee on campus and is always packed.

**July 4th:**

It's the 4th of July so me and two of my REU friends went to go see the fireworks at the Post. The Post Houston is a big food court with a roof which used to be a Post office but it shut down and they converted it into a food hall. I've been there a couple of times and it's really nice. We could see the fireworks from Freedom over Texas.

**July 6th:** 

That day, I was working on editing the previous code that I ran on my politicians' dataset so that it would also work on my new athletes and actors datasets. However, when I began to start editing my code I realized that I first needed to make txt files for each dataset so that I could use their names and image names to run it through each CLIP model. Since last year we have revised my code so that I didn't have to run each CLIP model at a time but now in one script, all 400M CLIP models are run on the datasets. For this reason, I began going back to each website that I scraped for the portraits and began writing down their gender, movie role, sport played, etc.

TO-DO FOR NEXT WEEK 
1. Finish running tests on new datasets
2. Start pulling demographic information from portraits
