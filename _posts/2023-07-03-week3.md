## Week 3 (July 3rd - July 7th)

**July 3rd:** 

Today, I got back to work on my code. Tomorrow is the 4th of July so I am trying to finish up most of my work today. From my work last Summer, I have webpages that detail the results of all my tests. For this reason, we want to start an API so that I can share my results with the public. This said I was working on adding all of the base benchmark scores under the photos of each politician for each model. This meant that I had to start using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to start writing scripts for the webpage. I was doing my work today in the coffee house at Rice which has the cheapest coffee on campus and is always packed.

**July 4th:**

It's the 4th of July so me and two of my REU friends went to go see the fireworks at the Post. The Post Houston is a big food court with a roof which used to be a Post office but it shut down and they converted it into a food hall. I've been there a couple of times and it's really nice. We could see the fireworks from Freedom over Texas.
