## Week 10 (August 21st - August 25th)

**August 21st:** <br/>  
Right here in the heart of Houston, Texas, our journey into computer engineering research has brought us closer to addressing gender bias, thanks to the fantastic CLIP model. And you know what? I had the pleasure of sitting down with my mentor, Vicente, and diving headfirst into this exciting exploration.

Armed with the powerful CLIP model, Vicente and I are on a mission to uncover and tackle gender bias in the way public figures are portrayed. We're delving deep into the issue, particularly how women are represented and discussed. Houston's rich diversity aligns seamlessly with our mission, reflecting the city's values of inclusivity and fairness. With CLIP's unique capabilities, we're sparking a conversation about gender bias in media, pushing us closer to a world where fairness and inclusivity are the norm. So stay tuned for our exciting strides as we lead the charge against gender bias in the capable hands of the CLIP model.

Thank you Houston once again!
