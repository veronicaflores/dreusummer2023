## Week 10 (August 21st - August 25th)

**August 21st:** <br/>  
In the heart of Houston, Texas, pioneering computer engineering research is making strides in the realm of gender bias analysis using the remarkable CLIP model. This transformative exploration of bias in a public figures dataset not only showcases the power of cutting-edge technology but also underscores the city's commitment to inclusivity and equity.

Houston's computer engineers, armed with the formidable CLIP model, are embarking on a mission to unveil and rectify gender bias within the representations of public figures. This research delves into a critical societal issue, aiming to shed light on the biases that may persist in how individuals, especially women, are portrayed and discussed. In a city celebrated for its diversity, the research on gender bias aligns seamlessly with Houston's values of inclusivity and fairness, demonstrating the city's dedication to addressing real-world problems and fostering a just society. With CLIP as a guiding light, Houston's research community advances the dialogue on gender bias in media representations, driving us closer to a world where inclusivity and fairness are the norms, not the exceptions. Stay tuned for the promising strides to come as Houston leads the way in the fight against gender bias with the aid of the CLIP model.

Thank you Houston once again!
